# TrackML Assembly 
(Replacement for [*TrackML JS*](https://github.com/AZP3001/main)

*AI RaceTrack Evolution, with a WebAssembly backend.*
[*To Simulation*](https://azp3001.github.io/trackml-assembly/)

A 2D race-track simulation where AIs learn to navigate a racetrack through evolution algorithms.

This is the same app as [AZP3001/main](https://github.com/AZP3001/main) — same UI, same tracks, same
editor, same saved-AI format. **The only difference is the backend: the simulation, the neural
networks, the evolution and the track geometry all run in WebAssembly instead of JavaScript.**
Tracks and brains move between the two versions untouched.

## Overview
The simulation puts a population of cars onto a track. Each car is controlled by a neural network which processes "lidar" data to produce continuous control outputs. Only the best performers pass their "genes" (weights) to the next generation.

### The Learning Process
The AIs have four primary control axes. To allow for more precise controls the axes are **analog (0-100%)**, allowing for more precise & smooth driving:
* **Gas**
* **Brake**
* **Steer Left**
* **Steer Right**

## The WebAssembly backend

Everything that costs CPU time lives in [`wasm/sim.c`](wasm/sim.c) — about 1200 lines of C compiled
to a single freestanding `wasm32` module. The physics step, the wall collisions, the seven sensor
raycasts per car, the neural network, the evolution, and the whole track generator are all in there.
`script.js` keeps the UI, the editor and the drawing; it no longer does any simulation.

### How it's built

Plain **clang**, not Emscripten:

```sh
./wasm/build.sh          # needs clang >= 15 and lld
```

That produces two modules and no JavaScript glue at all:

| file | size | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wasm/sim.wasm` | ~34 KB | scalar |
| `wasm/sim-simd.wasm` | ~38 KB | adds 128-bit SIMD (`-msimd128`) |

`engine.js` probes the browser for SIMD support and loads whichever it can run. There is no libc in
the build, so `sin`, `cos`, `atan2`, `tanh`, `acos` and `exp` are implemented in `sim.c` too — see
[Testing](#testing) for how they're kept honest.

Both files are committed, because GitHub Pages serves this repository as-is and they *are* the
backend. CI rebuilds them from source on every push and fails if the bytes differ, so they can't
drift from `sim.c`.

### Why not shared-memory threads

Threads inside one wasm instance need `SharedArrayBuffer`, which needs `COOP`/`COEP` response
headers, which GitHub Pages cannot send. So instead each worker gets its **own** instance with its
own memory and a contiguous slice of the population. Cars never interact, so the partition is exact,
it scales across cores the same way, and it needs no special headers.

## Configuration & Settings
Fine-tune the simulation and the learning process using the built-in settings.

### AI & Evolutionary Parameters
* **Pop Size:** The number of agents generated per generation.
* **Elite Clones:** Number of top-performing agents preserved exactly for the next generation (prevents regression).
* **Mutation Rate:** The probability and intensity of random changes to the neural weights.
* **Hidden Layers:** Adjust the complexity of the AI's "brain" by changing the number of internal neurons.
* **Initial TTL (Time-To-Live):** A countdown timer for each agent. Agents must reach checkpoints to reset this timer, ensuring they don't just sit still.
* **Target Laps:** Defines the goalpost for a successful generation before moving to the next stage of evolution.

### Physics Engine
* **Max Speed:** Maximum Speed of the Cars.
* **Acceleration:** Acceleration to the Max Speed.
* **Turn Speed:** Controls how quickly the cars are able to turn.
* **Grip:** Doesnt do much, introduced as a fix for turning Physics.

### Simulation Control
* **Simulation Speed:** Adjust the simulation speed.
* **Hyper Mode:** Simulates as fast as your PC allows. (Doesn't render for even faster Processing)

## Spectator Mode
Click any car on the track to pin the telemetry panel and sensor overlay to it — it stays highlighted until it crashes or you click empty space / hit "Release". With nothing selected, the panel auto-follows whichever car currently has the best fitness.

## Track Editor
### How a track is built
A track is a closed centre line plus a width. The road surface is everything within that width of the centre line — the same shape you'd get by stroking the line with a fat round pen — and the barriers are traced along the outside edge of exactly that shape, as one continuous wall per side. So the road is the same width the whole way round, the walls always sit on the edge of the asphalt, and where a track crosses or runs into itself the two bits of road simply join up instead of leaving stray walls in the middle of the road.

Each point on the path is a turn, and turns are real circular arcs:
* **Rounded:** an arc of the radius you set on the slider.
* **Corner:** the tightest arc the track width still allows — sharp, but never so sharp that nothing fits through it.

A turn is never allowed to be tighter than the road is wide, and neighbouring turns share out the straight between them, so putting two points close together softens both instead of kinking the road.

The generator runs in wasm, which matters here more than it looks: the editor rebuilds the entire
track on every frame you drag a point, and the walls come back as flat `Float32Array`s the canvas
can stroke directly rather than as thousands of freshly allocated point objects.

### Auto width

A closed loop can easily come back on itself. Where two passes of the track run close together, the
road at its full width swallows the gap between them and the barrier that should separate them
disappears — the two bits of road merge into one slab. **Auto Width** fixes that by narrowing the
road there instead.

It finds, for every point on the centre line, the nearest part of the track that isn't simply
further along the road, and caps the width so a barrier still fits between the two. The awkward part
is telling "the track curving round a corner" apart from "a different part of the track"; that's
done by arc length, with a window sized to the tightest turn the generator will ever build, so an
ordinary hairpin is left alone and a genuine near miss is not.

The slider next to the checkbox decides how the narrowing is applied:

* **Local** (far left) — only the tight spots narrow, the rest of the track keeps its full width.
* **Global** (far right) — the whole track takes the narrowest width it needs anywhere, so it stays
  one even width the whole way round.
* Anywhere between blends the two.

Narrowing tapers over a couple of track widths rather than stepping, and never goes below the width
a car can physically get through. It's on by default for drawn and image-imported tracks, which are
the ones where you can't judge the clearances by eye, and off for tracks you place by hand.

Besides placing points by hand, the editor has three ways to build a track:
* **Draw:** switch to the Draw tab and drag a loop directly on the canvas — it's simplified into an editable path automatically.
* **Import from Image:** upload a PNG/JPG (a hand-drawn loop or a photo of a track layout) and it's analyzed (thresholded, skeletonized, traced) into a starting track for you to refine.
* **Duplicate:** clone the currently-selected track as a starting point for a variant.

Tracks you create last for the session. **Nothing is cached or persisted** — see below.

### Keeping a track
Hit **Save Track** and the editor hands you a `generateTrackFromPath(...)` line for it. Paste that
into `tracks.js` and the track is built into the app for everyone on the next deploy.

There is no Publish button. It used to open a prefilled GitHub issue that a workflow turned into a
pull request; posting a track directly instead would need a server to post it *to*, and this is a
static site on GitHub Pages with no backend, so that was removed rather than left as the GitHub
detour. The code export above is the replacement.
